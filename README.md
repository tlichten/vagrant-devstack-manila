# TAPSTER

Use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) to create an **experimental** Clustered Data Ontap simulator environment

##### Credits
This project makes use of the excellent instructions on [how to simulate Data ONTAP 8.1.1. with Virtualbox by BOBSHOUSEOFCARDS](http://community.netapp.com/t5/Simulator-Discussions/Simulate-ONTAP-8-1-1-withVirtualBox/m-p/2227#M89)

##### Caution
This project is **experimental** and uses [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) which is a **non-supported** configuration for the simulator. There are smaller *hacks* for making this work and it is not pretty. Use at own risk. Please see known issues at the bottom.

##### Goal
The goal of this project is to experimentally provide a largely automated, turn-key setup of a Clustered Data Ontap simulator using Vagrant in order to ease demos, speed up testing, and help become more familiar with cDot and its integration in projects like OpenStack.

## System requirements

 - 8 GB RAM
 - 15-20 GB of free disk space
 - SSD recommended
 - Linux / Mac / Windows
 - Internet connection

## Prerequisites

 - [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed
 - [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) installed
 - Access to the NetApp support site to download the cDot simulator. Site access may be limited to customers and partners.

## Installation

 - If you use [Git](http://git-scm.com/), clone this repo. If you don't use Git, [download](https://github.com/tlichten/tapster/archive/master.zip) the project and extract it.
 - Download [*Clustered Data Ontap 8.2.3 Simulator for VMware Workstation, VMware Player, and VMware Fusion*](http://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/tools/simulator/ontap/8.X/)
 - Save the downloaded file ```vsim_netapp-cm.tgz``` to this project's root directory, e.g. ```~/vagrant-vsim/vsim_netapp-cm.tgz```
 - Configure the Cluster base license. **Important**: Use the **non-ESX build** license. Edit ```vsim.conf```, at the top set the 8.2.3 Cluster base license within ```CLUSTER_BASE_LICENSE``` accordingly. The license can be obtained from the [support site](http://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/tools/simulator/ontap/8.X/).
 - Optionally, edit  ```vsim.conf ``` and configure any additional licenses as a comma separated list within  ```LICENSES ``` accordingly. **Important**: Use the **non-ESX build licenses**. The additional licenses can be obtained from the [support site](http://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/tools/simulator/ontap/8.X/).
 - **Double check** you have added the **non-ESX build** licenses.
 
## Usage

 - From this directory, e.g.  ```~/vagrant-vsim/```, run:
```bash
$ vagrant up
```
 - You will be asked to import the simulator as a Vagrant box on first run. Press ```y``` to proceed and import. The import will take a few minutes.
 - Wait until the VSim is ready. Once ready, to access the VSim console run:
```bash
$ vagrant ssh vsim
```
 - When done, you can destroy the entire environment. Run:
```bash
$ vagrant destroy
```

## Uninstall

 - From this directory, e.g.  ```~/vagrant-vsim/```, run:
```bash
$ vagrant destroy
$ vagrant box remove VSim
$ vagrant box remove ubuntu/trusty64
```
 - Uninstall Virtualbox and Vagrant

## Known issues

 - There is **no error handling** in place, please do not just abort the program when things take a while. At first start, please be patient, preparing the VSim Vagrant box can take several minutes.
 - Occassionaly, ```vagrant destroy``` will error and can not delete all VM disks. Manual deletion is required.
 - The setup is limited to a single node cluster
